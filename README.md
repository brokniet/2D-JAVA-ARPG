# 2D JAVA ARPG

2D-JAVA-ARPG is the first time in a long time that I'll use Java to (attempt) to build a decent game.
I've built a few in the past, but they were much more simplier.
This time I have a bigger project in mind, and for that I listed a few things I want to do with this project, for at least call it a prototype.

# To Do List:

1. Nice and fluid player movement
2. Camera that follows the player
3. Arena-like map with different textures and zones
4. Enemies and entities that interact with the player
5. Frenetic combat with weapons and spells
